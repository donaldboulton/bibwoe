### Jekyll Admin for Local Host

Cannot stop myself from opening VS 2017 to do work. When I get it down I will be doing alot of bundle exec jekyll serve and then going to my root and going to Jekyll Admin to build my sites as /admin.

Jekyll admin makes it so easy for me to add new pages, posts or any type of content, including file management, adding images to .md pages and Changing Configuration.

Adding more to this post as it will continue to develop.
