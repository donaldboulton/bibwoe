# Prayer

## Pray For What You already Have

Pray for what you have already been given in perfection? What We have stated before, is that Satan the Devils job is to test, accuse and distract you from the truth he is very specialized in convincing you of the ways of untruth and lies of what Father Gods will for man is. The un-truths given by Satan to man, mankind has fully accepted as truth, like, "Prayer, Ownership and Music" among others. His main lies keep you doing lies and is what distracts you from the truth. The three P's = Pray and Play see: [Pay Attention](http://www.bibwoe.com/blog/Devil "Devil as Satan") and Pity, all three are useless and distraction's from doing what was intended by Fathers Will. Prayer is to deny thy Father. Our words are in

### What Jesus would have told us in 2018

About prayer is not much different than what was written in

#### Matthew 6:5- 6:6

And It simply means do not pray, and affirmed in

#### Matthew 17

 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

Prayer = To pray, ”(prey)”, or to be prayed upon. Before you ask for something check to see if you do not already have it! If you can My Children imagine a hopeless situation, you are pray and you must find the true warrior inside of you, seeking the innate responses to sustain your existence from this foe. This is prayer to seek your existence, to become alive within yourself, to defeat the enemy that preys upon you = Prayer .

## Power Of Man In

### Matthew 17:20

The word is not exactly as Jesus teaches at the festival and tells of circumcising and how it was not that Moses but His and their ancestors, ways that were being portrayed. Determining worship for and because of their Paganism patterns, and it was from various forms hats, symbolism, idols, prayer and to congregate to worship. You are doing exactly as your fathers do and/or did, or forever their will to power over you will continue. Be reborn into the kingdom of God and away from the things of Man. For we have all power and its of being born and designed of the light. Break the bonds of Old lies, nonsense, hate and evil = constant sin’s. Your forefathers lies and wars and hate are not of the future and should be thrown away. = This is part of Being born Again.

#### Matthew 6:5

And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

### Truth

Jesus is trying to explain without totally alienating his audience and getting stoned to death. Jesus said do not pray for to pray is to want, for all has been given of your needs. But history and a patterned existence has let you with a determined will to exist in the past, things against that norm are at least shunned if not destroyed, He did not plan to stop his teachings so short, as would have soon told you that prayer is a sin and a denial of the truth in creation (which is of perfection from the Father!)

#### Mat 6:6

But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

#### Mat 6:7

But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

#### Mat 6:8

Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
